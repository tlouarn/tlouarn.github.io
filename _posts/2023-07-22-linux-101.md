**Linux** is an open-source operating system. Its core components are a boot loader, a kernel, basic services including a shell, and a package manager. Linux can also come with a display manager and some applications (like LibreOffice or GIMP).

There are tons of different Linux distributions, but most of them belong to a specific **family**. The three main families of distributions are:

Since I use Ubuntu on my WSL and Amazon EC2, and Ubuntu belongs to the Debian family, I will only write down useful commands and tools from the Debian family.

# The file system

The file system works as a [tree](/graph-theory-101). Unlike Windows where there can be multiple roots like `C:\` and `D:\`, Linux only has one root and it is accessible via `/`. All other files, directories and partitions are located under the root. In particular, multiple drives are mounted under `/mnt`.

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) describes the main top-level directories located just under the root:

| name | description |
| --- | ---| 
| **/bin** | user binaries |
| **/boot**| boot loader files |
| **/dev**| device files |
| **/etc**| configuration files |
| **/home**| home directories |
| **/lib**| system libraries |
| **/media**| removable devices |
| **/mnt**| mount directory |
| **/opt**| optional applications |
| **/proc**| process information |
| **/root**| home directory for the root user |
| **/sbin**| system binaries |
| **/srv**| service data |
| **/tmp**| temporary files |
| **/usr**| multi-user programs |
| **/var** | variable files |

Notes:  
* The file system is **case-sensitive**  
* Each user has a directory under **/home** named after him  
* **/proc** contains virtual files that only exist in memory  
* **/etc** contains system configuration files (only the root user can edit)  
* **/lib** contains dynamically loaded libraries

# The command line

The command line is a text-based interface where users can interact with the operating system by typing commands. The basic structure of a command is:

```cmd
command [flags] [arguments]
```

The **command** is the program or action to run. The **flags** are optional and modify the behavior of the command if needed. The **arguments** are the input of the command. For example, typing `df -Th /` displays the amount of available **disk space** for the root filesystem along with their type and human-readable numbers. We can break down this instruction as follows:

| part | description |
| --- | --- |
| `df` | disk free |
| `-T` | displays the filesystem type (e.g. ext4) | 
| `-h` | show the sizes in human-readable format (KB, MB, GB) |
| `/` | applies the command and flags to the root |

# Navigating the directory

Below are some basic commands to navigate the directory and manipulate files.

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `pwd` | print working directory |
| `cd`| change directory |
| `cd ~` | change to your home directory |
| `cd ..` | change to parent directory |
| `cd -` |  change to previous directory |
| `cd /` | change to the root directory |
| `ls` | list the contents of the directory |
| `tree` | display a tree view of the filesystem |
| `pushd` | push the current directory onto a stack for later use and move to the specified directory |
| `popd` | change to the top directory off the stack |

Some flags often used with the `ls` command:

* `ls -a` lists **all** contents including hidden files and directories
* `ls -i` includes the **inode** of each file
* `ls -h` displays files sizes in a **human**\-readable format
* `ls -l` shows more information

Flags can be combined: `ls -aihl` does all of the above at once. `ls` also works with Globbing patterns, such as `ls *.txt` to list all files with a txt extension.

In order to get help on any command, type `man [command]` (which stands for "manual"). For instance, to get help on `find`, type `man find`. This proves useful when looking for specific flags. To interrupt a command, type `Ctrl + C`. To clear the command line, type `Ctrl + L`. 

# Manipulating files and directories

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `cat` | print content onto the standard output stream |
| `head`| print the first 10 lines of a file |
| `tail`| print the last 10 lines of a file |
| `less`| print a file one page at a time |
| `touch`| create a file |
| `mv`| rename a file |
| `rm`| remove a file |
| `rm -rf`| empty a directory recursively |
| `rmdir`| remove a directory (only works when the directory is empty) |
| `mkdir`| create a directory |
| `ln`| create a symbolic link |
| `diff` | compare files and directories |
| `file` | give the real nature of a file |
| `cp` | copy files on the local machine |
| `patch` | apply changes to a file (changes are contained in patchfiles) |
| `which` | locate a program | 
| `whereis` | locate searching in a broader range | 

Note: most applications open the file rather than rely on extensions. Extensions are more useful for the user than for the system. Hence the `file` command.

# The package manager

**APT** (Advanced Package Tool) is the default package manager on Debian. It is made of two components which are `apt-get` (high-level package manager used for dependency resolution) and `dpkg` (low-level package manager working under the hood). Most of the time we use `apt-get`.

Example commands:

|command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `apt-get upgrade` | upgrade all installed packages to their latest version |
| <code>dpkg --list &#124; grep zip</code> | show all installed packages which name contains "zip" |

# Editing files

On the command-line, we can use Nano or Vi.

From the shell, let's add "Hello World" to **file1**, then print the contents of **file1** to the command line:

```shell
$ echo "Hello World" > file1
$ cat file1
Hello World
```

To open the file in Nano, type `nano my_file`.

# User management

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | information about the current user |
| `id [username]` | information about [username] |
| `sudo useradd [username]` | add a new user named [username] |
| `sudo userdel [username]` | delete user [username] |
| `sudo userdel [username] -r` | fully delete [username] including his **home** directory |

Each user has a unique **id**. Groups gather users with common access rights and privileges. Normal users start at **1000**. All users are created with at least one group which id is equal to their uid.

| file | description |
| --- | --- |
| **/etc/group** | list of groups |
| **/etc/passwd** | list of users |

The **/etc/passwd** file is organized as follows:

```shell
username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell
```

How to search **/etc/passwd** for a specific user (here for user "root"):

```shell
$ grep root /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
|`useradd` | add a user directory under **/home** and add a line to  **/etc/passwd** |
| `userdel` | delete a user but leave the home directory unless `userdel -r` |
| `groupadd` | create a new group on the system |
| `groupdel`| delete an existing group from the system |
| `whoami` | display the current logged-in user name |
| `su` | switch user : launch a new shell running as another user |

It is bad practice to use `su` to switch to root account. Instead, better use `sudo` on a user. This way, **sudo** privileges are granted to a specific user but only last for a specific command.

Every file is associated with a user and a group

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `chown` | change user ownership of a file or directory |
| `chgrp` | hange group ownership |
| `chmod` | change the permissions on the file for **owner**, **group** and **other** |

![Illustration of chmod](/assets/images/tlouarn-linux-101-chmod.drawio.svg)

# Environment variables

**Environment variables** are specific variables used by the shell.

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `env` | Print current environment variable to the shell |
| `env &#124; head` | Only print the first 10 variables |
| `echo $SHELL` | Print the environment variable named **SHELL** | 


**PS1** customize your prompt

**SHELL** default shell for the current user, usually **bash**

bash:
`history` history of commands entered

`history | tail` show last 10


otherwise navigate using up/down arrow keys

Ctrl+R: search in history of past commands

Tab: autocomplete

# Manipulating files

`cat` short for **concatenate**

    $ cat readme.txt

main purpose is to concatenate multiple files together

Some files are very large. Opening the file in an editor may consume too much memory. Using `less` allows to load page by page, not saturating the memory along with `head` and `tail`.

```shell
$ tail -15 somefile.log
$ tail -f somefile.log
```
`tail -f` continuously monitors new lines in the log file and displays them in stdout

Text utilities

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `cat` | Concatenate files (can also read and print files) |
| `less` | Print the contents of a file in the shell page by page |
| `head`| Show the first 10 lines of a file |
| `tail`| Show the last 10 lines of a file |
| `sed`| Edit data streams (filter and perform substitutions) |
| `awk`| Pattern scanning and processing |
| `sort`| Sort text files and output streams |
| `uniq`| Remove duplicate consecutive lines |
| `paste`| Combine fields from different files |
| `join`| Enhanced version of paste |
| `split`| Break up large files into equal segments |
| `wc`| Display the number of lines and words in a file |
| `cut`| Cut sections in each line of a file |
| `grep` | Search text files and input streams (works with regex) |

# Streams and pipes

**Standard streams** are communication channels between a computer program and its environment. When we launch a Linux command, three data streams are created:

* **stdin**: standard input
* **stdout**: standard output
* **stderr**: standard error

When a command is executed via a shell, the streams are connected to the terminal on which the shell is running.

Streams can be directed and changed using `>` and `<`:

```shell
$ do_something < input_file
$ do_something > output_file
$ do_something 2> output_file
```

Programs can be chained together, where the **stdout** of the previous program is the **stdin** of the next:

```shell
$ command_1 | command_2 | command_3
```

When several commands are chained together, each command does not have to wait for the previous command to finish before starting.

Searching for files:

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `locate` | |
| `grep` | filter |
| <code>locate zip | grep bin</code> | print all files containing both "zip" and "bin" |
| `find` | |

# Processes

Some clarification around the terminology:

* a **program** is an executable sequence of instructions
* a **process** is the running instance of a program
* a **thread** is a lightweight process
* a **service** is process running in the background

A process can run one or several threads, and can also run other processes.

There are two main commands to monitor processes:

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| `ps` | reports a snapshot of current processes |
| `top` | task manager that displays information about CPU and memory utilization (auto-refresh)|

A process can be defined by:
- ID type
- Description
- Process ID (PID)
- Unique Process ID number
- Parent Process ID (PPID)
- PID of the parent process
- Thread ID (TID)
- Thread ID number

For single-threaded processes, TID=PID. For multi-threaded processes, each thread shares the same PID but has a unique TID. To terminate a process: `kill -SIGKILL <pid>`. You can only terminate your own processes (unless you are root). Processes have priorities (their `nice` value, the lower the higher the priority). The "niceness" of a process is its priority. You can can change the niceness of a process from the CLI via `renice` command.

# Cron

**Cron** makes it possible to launch background jobs at specific times.

We can schedule tasks by editing the **crontab** file (for **cron table**). We can access the crontab file by typing \`crontab -e\` ("crontab edit"). There are both system-wide and user-specific crontab files.

Cron instructions follow a specific format made of 6 fields:

| Field | Description | values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MIN | Minutes | 0 to 59|
| HOUR | Hours | 0 to 23 |
| DOM | Day Of Month | 1 to 31 |
| MON | Month | 1 to 12 |
| DOW | Day of Week | 0 to 6 (0 = Sunday) |
| CMD  | Command | Any command to be executed |

Example of cron schedule expression to run `script.sh` everyday at 1AM:

```shell
0 1 * * * /path/to/my/script.sh
```

# Networks

A network is a group of computers connected together via communication channels. Each device has an **IP** address (unique logical network address). A **DNS** converts a hostname into an IP address.

An IPv4 address is dividend into 4 bytes:
* class A network address: first octet as Net ID, other 3 as Host ID max 126 class A. Classes A go from `1.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255` (i.e. 16.7m unique hosts)
* classes B and C were added later:
class b: 2 bits 65k unique hosts
class c network addresses: first 3 octets as NET ID, last as host ID 2.1m available. Classes C go from `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`

Home network only has 1 IP address. Within the network, you can assign IPs to connected devices either statically or dynamically (DHCP).

**NAT** = Network Address Translation, allows to share 1 IP address among many locally connected computers, each of which has a unique address only seen on the local network. In a home network, the router acts as a NAT.

Important files:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/etc/resolv.conf** | |
| **/etc/hosts**| |
| **/etc/network** | |

Network interfaces are points of connection between a computer and a network.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ip` | |
| `ifconfig` | Display active network interfaces |
| `hostname` | Display current host name |
| `host` | Show IP address for a domain name |
| `nslookup` | Same |
| `ping` | Check whether remote host is alive and responding |
| `route`  ||
| `netstat` ||
| `nmap` ||
| `wget` | Download web pages |
| `curl` ||
| `ssh` | Crytographic network protocol |
| `scp` | Secure copy between 2 network hosts, uses SSH protocol |
| `ssh <hostname> <command>` | SSH Tunnel |
